# .htaccess — What It Is, When to Use It, and Basic Syntax

## What is `.htaccess`
`.htaccess` is a **per-directory configuration file for the Apache web server**.

It allows you to define **server-level rules** (access control, URL rewriting, file handling, authentication, etc.) **without editing the global Apache config** or restarting the server.

Apache automatically reads `.htaccess` **on every request** for the directory it’s in (and its subdirectories), **if overrides are allowed**.

## When `.htaccess` Is Used
`.htaccess` is used when:
- You **don’t have root access** to the server
- Shared hosting environments
- You need **directory-specific rules**
- Quick configuration changes without restarting Apache

In CTFs, it often appears because:
- Developers misuse it for “security”
- It’s forgotten, readable, writable, or uploadable
- It allows **behavior override → bypasses → RCE**

## How `.htaccess` Works (Request Flow)
1. Client requests a URL
2. Apache locates the target directory
3. Apache checks for `.htaccess`
4. Rules inside `.htaccess` are applied
5. File is handled (executed, blocked, rewritten, etc.)

Important: `.htaccess` rules are applied **before application code** (PHP, Django, etc.).

## Common Things You Can Do with `.htaccess`

### 1. Restrict Access
```apache
Deny from all
```

### 2.Execute PHP inside `.txt` files:
```
AddType application/x-httpd-php .txt
```
